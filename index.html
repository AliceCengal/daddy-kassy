    <h4>Q: How do I edit or delete an entry?</h4>
    <p>A: DOUBLE-CLICK the row that you want to edit or delete. That row will be deleted
      and its details will be copied to the input row above it. You can edit that input row
      and press ENTER (or CLICK the + button) to resubmit the edit, or ignore it for
      a full delete.</p>
    <h4>Q: What is Income?</h4>
    <p>A: Any money that you receive. Salary, bonus, stipend, compensation, investment
      dividend, someone paying back a personal loan, bank account balance carryover at the
      start of the financial year, ...</p>
    <h4>Q: What is Expense?</h4>
    <p>A: Any money that you spend. Buying something, paying fees and penalties,
      paying taxes, paying loan installments, ...</p>
    <h4>Q: What is Gross Worth?</h4>
    <p>A: Gross Worth = Total Income &minus; Total Expense</p>
    <h4>Q: What is Net Worth?</h4>
    <p>A: Net Worth = Gross Worth + Total Obligation</p>
    <h4>Q: What is Obligation?</h4>
    <p>A: Deferred expense and income. A positive obligation is when someone/something
      promises to pay you a specific amount at a later date (deferred income). A negative
      obligation is when you promise to pay someone/something a specific amount at a
      later date (deferred expense).</p>
    <p> Recording deferred expense/income helps you better understand your financial
      position at a particular moment. Your goal in this game is to try keep both
      your gross worth and net worth above zero. Between net worth and gross worth,
      the lower amount represents your discretionary fund that you can spend on
      entertainment or luxury. Stop any luxury spending before you dip into
      negative worth.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> You have a big yearly payment commitment (motor
      insurance, college tuition, property tax, club membership) of $6000.
      An easy way to spread out this commitment/obligation is to record the amount
      divided by 12 as a negative obligation on every month. This is an example of
      deferred expense. Even though you haven't made the payment yet, you pretend
      that you have made fractions of the payment by recording it as a negative
      obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 1-Feb | tuition | -$500</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 1-Mar | tuition | -$500</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 1-Apr | tuition | -$500</span>
    </p>
    <p>This will automatically deduct that amount from your net worth, which signals
      that you don't have as much discretionary fund as your bank account statement might
      tell you. At the end of the year, when it's time to pay that commitment, record it
      as an expense, and also record the same amount as a positive obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 31-Dec | tuition | $6000</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 31-Dec | tuition | $6000</span>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 2: </strong> You lend $300 to a friend, who promises to
      pay it back in three months. Record it as an expense, and also as a positive obligation
      by the same amount. This signals that while there is less money in your
      bank account, you have more worth available that is locked up. This is an
      example of deferred income. Even though you haven't received the money yet,
      you pretend as if you have received the money by recording it as a positive
      obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 24-Feb | loan to John | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 24-Feb | loan to John | $300</span>
    </p>
    <p>When the friend pays the loan back, record it as an income, and also a negative
      obligation by the same amount.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>INCOME     | 24-May | loan to John | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 24-May | loan to John | -$300</span>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 3: </strong> You borrow $300 from a friend, promising to
      pay it back in three months. Record it as an income, and also as a negative obligation
      by the same amount. This signals that while there is more money in your
      bank account, this is not part of your discretionary fund. This is an
      example of deferred expense. Even though you haven't paid back the loan yet,
      you pretend as if you have paid the loan by recording it as a negative
      obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>INCOME     | 24-Feb | loan from John | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 24-Feb | loan from John | -$300</span>
    </p>
    <p>When the you pay the loan back, record it as an expense, and also a positive
      obligation by the same amount.</p>

    <h4>Q: How do I record investments and savings?</h4>
    <p>A: You could record your deposits into an investment account as an expense,
      paired with a positive obligation. This signals that while your checking account
      balance may be low, you have a significant amount of worth tied up elsewhere.
      The dividend is recorded as income if you withdraw it, or as a positive obligation
      if you immediately reinvest it.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 26-Feb | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 26-Feb | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 26-Mar | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 26-Mar | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 26-Apr | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 26-Apr | invest   | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>INCOME     | 01-May | dividend | $550</span>
    </p>
    <p>When you withdraw from an investment account, record it as an income,
      paired with an equal amount of negative obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>INCOME     | 17-Oct | investment | $70,000</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 17-Oct | investment | -$70,000</span>
    </p>
    <p>But some people have a phobia of excess fund. You could also record investment
      deposits simply as expense, treating the amount in your investment account as
      a mystery so that you can't be tempted to spend it. Withdrawing from the
      investment account then is just an income.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 26-Feb | invest    | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 26-Mar | invest    | $300</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 26-Apr | invest    | $300</span><br />

    <h4>Q: How do I record credit card transaction?</h4>
    <p>A: When you charge a purchase on a credit card, you haven't actually paid
      anything yet. Since this is a deferred expense, you can record it as a
      negative obligation. When you pay the credit card balance at the end of
      the month, then it is an expense, paired with a positive obligation of
      the same amount.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 5 Jul  | clothing | -$50</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 6 Jul  | grocery  | -$80</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 7 Jul  | coffee   | -$20</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE    | 31 Jul | cc bal   | $150</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>OBLIGATION | 31 Jul | cc bal   | $150</span>
    </p>
    <p>However, if you are the kind of person that uses a credit card as
      if it is a debit card and fully pays off the balance every month,
      you could just record every credit card charge like a normal expense.
      In this case, the payment of credit card balance at the end of the month
      is not recorded.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 5 Jul | clothing | $50</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 6 Jul | grocery  | $80</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 7 Jul | coffee   | $20</span>

    <h4>Q: How do I record cash withdrawal?</h4>
    <p>** This is written assuming that you are a millenial adult living in a
      fairly developed country who doesn't really use cash for significant expenses all
      that much anymore.</p>
    <p>A: Technically, cash withdrawal is not any kind of transaction. Only when you
      buy something with that cash would it become an expense. However, since cash
      is often used for small purchases that are tedious to record, it's easier
      to just record the cash withdrawal as an expense to lump together all of your
      small cash expenses.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 13-Mar | cash withdraw | $300</span>
    </p>
    <p>In the rare case where you had to make a big expense with cash, you may
      record it as such. Let's say you withdraw $500 to buy an item for $467 cash.</p>
    <p>
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 26-Mar | antique clock | $467</span><br />
      <span class='text-code'>EXPENSE | 26-Mar | cash withdraw | $33</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Q: Why doesn't the app save data to the server?</h4>
    <p>A: That would be convenient for sure, but is a privacy risk. You should store
      your financial records locally, or on a secure file hosting service.</p>
    <h4>Q: How do I transition to the next financial year?</h4>
    <p>A: On the New page, type your current Gross Worth into the Starting Balance field,
      and your current total Obligation into the Starting Obligation field.</p>
